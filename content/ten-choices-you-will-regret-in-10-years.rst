“If only…” These two words paired together create one of the saddest phrases in the English language.
Here are ten choices that ultimately lead to this phrase of regret, and how to elude them:

#. Wearing a mask to impress others
#. Letting someone else create your dreams for you
#. Keeping negative company
#. Being selfish and egotistical
#. Avoiding change and growth
#. Giving up when the going gets tough
#. Trying to micromanage every little thing
#. Settling for less than you deserve
#. Endlessly waiting until tomorrow
#. Being lazy and wishy-washy
